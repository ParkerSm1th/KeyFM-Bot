@everyone Introducing **Staff Points**
The way that these work is you have an overall reputation that goes from -10 to 10. (Hitting -10 will result in a suspension).

You can get positive points just from having a good show or even interacting in the discord with guests! http://prntscr.com/sn8m8c

As you can see I have a reputation of +2 for getting staff of the week which is worth +2 reputation. Keep a good reputation and your chances of promotion go up! Good luck and I hope you all enjoy this system :)

Figured I'd ask, is there any automated system that allows us to gain points? when this was in place at bounce, there wasn't anyone giving away points

**Quick Change**
For security reasons you can only have one instance of the panel open at a time. If you for example logged into the panel on your phone you would be logged out on your computer. Thanks for your understanding ðŸ™‚

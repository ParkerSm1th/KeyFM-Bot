TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:16:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
you want to host it for no reason

also where ever we're hosting at the moment if the ddos protection doesn't hold up we need to move
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:17:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I would rather be paying for something and know if stuff goes wrong, we have someone to contact
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:17:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And they cant use the fact that we're using it for free
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:17:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)
but you aren't paying

I dont see the issue with small ads for a small amount of money just to cancel out our fees
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 18:18:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
really the ads are for the radio server
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:18:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We dont want to make any profit
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:18:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's just so we dont have to pay from our pocket
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 18:18:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I’m fine with paying for the VPS bc i’ll use it anyways
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 18:18:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
but for the radio server i don’t see the problem
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 18:19:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Shoutca.st works great and it’s only $10 a month and I like it way better than azuracast
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 18:19:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Everyone’s moved away from azuracast
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:19:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
yes im fine with it i just dont want to go down the road of being looked at as money grabbing when i want to partner with charities
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:19:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and i want to partner with non profit companies
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 18:19:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That’s fine but we aren’t making any profit w these ads so I don’t see the issue
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:19:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
None of us are here for profit
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:19:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We just dont want to be taking out of our own, so any profit will go to charity

<@!201124404254605312> so just to be clear u are okay with the ads?
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:23:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
im okay with it just want to make it clear
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:24:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
also make a business paypal @here ALL OF US HAVE ACCESS at all times.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 18:24:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)

TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:24:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
its not going to a personal paypal
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:25:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I think that's a huge risk personally if someone decides to leave, I think we have to have two trustees to the account.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:26:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's not for profit anyway, so I think it should go to the personal of who is paying as we know how many ads are running each week and if they dont declare the money, we all know who it is
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:27:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)

TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:29:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
the way you say that
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:29:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
doesn't sound trust worthy
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:29:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
its like your planning to remove an owner 😂
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:29:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't expect any of you too, but I am way too established in the community to believe that no one will at some point
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:31:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
okay put it this way:

Parker: has but all this work in to the website/panel
Julia: Paid for certain tghins
Chris: Also paid for things and is doing lots of work on typing stuff up etc
Me: contacting companies/potential partners which is a lot of work and time
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:31:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
why would any one of us leave?
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:31:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)
because i know for certain if parker leaves, thats the site gone
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:32:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Because people at Slur did that all but they also had tendencies to leave and that is how it goes.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:33:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
If you all agree on having a business paypal,  we can have a business paypal but I do not like the idea one bit
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:35:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And without being rude, that is because Parker has said he doesnt want money for the VPS so he does not need access, You aren't paying any recurring payments so you dont need access. Im not paying any monthly recurring, so I dont need access. Julia is currently paying for the radio server and I want her not to have to by the use of ads
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:35:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So she is the only one that truly needs access

It is convenient that all the pings when the website went down came from one IP
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:36:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)

im trying to work together
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:37:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)
what website?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:37:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
The Key website a few days ago?
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:37:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Right what IP did the site get hit off?
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:37:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)
are you saying I hit the site off?
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:38:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
my own radio?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:40:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm not saying that, I'm saying that I dont know who would target it right now and the fact we noticed it by the minute has me concerned that it is someone here. And I agree Charlie got kicked out but also some other owners left as well and high ranking staff.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:40:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It happened frequently
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:40:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And by someone here I mean someone in the radio
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:40:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Not in this chat btw
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:40:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
its funny how i was the only one who knew the website was offline and I was trying to access it which would mean yes I was accessing the website

I'm not accusing you, there is no need to get so defensive
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:42:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'll be back later, I'm going for dinner.
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:42:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)
kinda sounds like you was when you was trying to argue with me? im confused why are you coming across so angry? 

all im doing is putting a point across about profit and how its not going to work when the website gets took down since we have no license to be putting ads on our website
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:43:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
any one of our competitors could report us which is what im worried about
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:43:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
UB ran and I believe still run adverts
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 18:43:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And have done for years
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:44:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
they have licenses
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:57:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and UB is money grabbing
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:57:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
which key should be about the community
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 18:57:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and what they want
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 19:00:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I've researched it and you dont need a license to run ads on ur website
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 19:00:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And we are about the community but I dont think we need to be out of our own pockets
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 19:14:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)
you definitely need license
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 19:14:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
to own a radio which takes money
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 19:15:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
but if the amount is low and going towards the radio
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 10 2020 19:15:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)
its okay
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 19:30:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yes you need licenses for a radio but I know for fact UB dont have those either

I think we have the upper hand on Rise now because Ashley has left
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 21:16:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)
why’d he leave
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 21:16:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
their site is also down for some reason
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 10 2020 21:16:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
i think cuz he was transferring stuff
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 21:16:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Apparently because he was fed up of the DDOSing issue.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 21:16:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
but Callum says its because Ashley wants to focus on his reto
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 10 2020 21:17:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and that he will start a radio for his retro soon

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon May 11 2020 02:25:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Really I feel as if all the radios seem to launch stuff around that time
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon May 11 2020 02:25:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
What about 9?
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Mon May 11 2020 02:25:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)

TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Mon May 11 2020 02:25:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
ive never seen something launch later than that
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon May 11 2020 02:25:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
UB strictly does 9pm
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Mon May 11 2020 02:26:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
do 9 then
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon May 11 2020 02:26:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)
With pre-launch shows before
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon May 11 2020 02:28:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Julia is at work at 9 our time

TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Mon May 11 2020 02:30:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Unless we do a meet the team page but that seems like something for a later date
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon May 11 2020 02:30:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Maybe Profiles and Meet the Team should be the next update after Splash
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon May 11 2020 02:30:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
True
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Mon May 11 2020 02:31:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)
i think the profiles we definitely should have just when clicking on their picture
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon May 11 2020 02:31:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Hello @here,

As an ownership team, we just wanted to acknowledge the leaks that took place of our staff panel this evening. We would just like to reiterate that our purpose is not to engage with the drama that has become so synonymous with the Radio Community and we refute any claims that the work done on our panel was stolen in any way what so ever. Parker is a very hardworking developer that has been part of the community for some time now, all code found on the Panel is by him or used in authorisation that was sought by him. 

Thank you,
KeyFM Ownership

I don't know if i'll be able to participate in a launch show - we're having really bad issues with my internet so we're getting the ISP up some time this week but they said they don't know when they can fix it, like i've been dropping out of calls all the time etc and even when i was live the other day, my brothers came in a few time saying that they couldnt use the internet because i was on.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Tue May 12 2020 22:15:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)

@here we should not allow double jobbing it won’t get us anywhere and will only result in leaks etc

@everyone - I am under the impression that Pulse is opening due to the closure of Rise
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue May 19 2020 14:08:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I think we need to look into how we can prevent that
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue May 19 2020 14:08:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
even if it means trying to come to an agreement with the people behind Pulse to bolster our admin team
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue May 19 2020 14:08:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and make us compete.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue May 19 2020 14:09:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
bc we will be looking at losing people such as Mystikal

I literally just asked if they were double jobbing, then for the mic test and said welcome
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Tue May 19 2020 20:31:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Juulia (187019416867831808) at Tue May 19 2020 20:31:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I also didn’t need to do a mic test cause I personally know the guy and his mic works

Maybe an idea to have Discord Verification on apps or something
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat May 30 2020 18:51:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)
so instead of entering the discord they have to like authorise using discord
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat May 30 2020 18:51:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and that sends their discord to us as well
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sat May 30 2020 18:52:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Move Sam down and keep admin the highest besides owner
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 31 2020 21:33:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:33:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:35:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That’s like different
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:36:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

<@!147751463907622914> made the sexy role
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:36:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Exec kinda gives us a middle ground
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:36:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So we don’t have to deal with the admins haha
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:36:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
In practice, it should mean we should literally have to do nothing
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 31 2020 21:37:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:37:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It isn't working rn tho bc our only Exec is Sam who is not Radio based
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sun May 31 2020 21:37:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Exec us something which is good for when owners cant be around all the time
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:37:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
hence why I mentioned Zane
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:37:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
but I would feel bad for Olly
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:37:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
bc he secured us this HabMe partnership
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:37:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and has done a SHIT TON for the radio
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:37:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I think it would be bad to promote 1 of them at the time
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:38:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Just cause Zane has been doing a lot overall and Olly of course is putting a lot in
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:38:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We should wait until the team grows
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:38:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yeah
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:38:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and we can justify promoting both
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:38:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Elliott’s argument for Olly’s boredom also plays into it
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:38:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He could get bored with us
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:39:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Not for the foreseeable future I don’t think cause we are growing and it’s exciting
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sun May 31 2020 21:39:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But if we hit like a plateau eventually he could dip
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 31 2020 21:39:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Maybe but I just don't see that happenning
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 31 2020 21:39:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun May 31 2020 21:39:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)

He's like a kid, he probably thinks pridefall is pro-pride or something or doesn't know about it properly ;/

<@!212630637365035009> i swear we agreed to player on the left side, you should have just came and told us you didn't want that ;/
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Fri Jun 05 2020 00:12:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)
instead of allowing me to tell Olly that is what we agreed and then it being changed
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Fri Jun 05 2020 00:12:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm not mad or anything, i'm just saying

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Fri Jun 05 2020 00:12:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Why don't you like it on the left?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Fri Jun 05 2020 00:12:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I think it brings uniqueness
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Fri Jun 05 2020 00:13:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I understand it's probably a pain to code ;/
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Fri Jun 05 2020 00:18:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But like I would rather find out that you want to change that from you rather than from an admin, even tho we literally share everything with them there has to be integrity to the ownership
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 05 2020 00:38:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Chance ➡️  Trial Head DJ
Bluey ➡️   Trial Extension. 
Kindal  ➡️  Community Manager (Instead of Admin).
Zane  ➡️  Trial Executive
Olly  ➡️  Trial Executive (Only 1 will get the final job, unless both impress a lot)
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 17:57:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Parker (212630637365035009) at Sat Jun 06 2020 17:58:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
actually community manager is fine
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 17:58:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Personally Sam doesn't fit in the Exec Role for me but we can keep him there if you want Parker.
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sat Jun 06 2020 17:59:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Parker (212630637365035009) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You asked for Reviews to be done this week Chris
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:01:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Should we move him to Administration instead?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:02:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Or a new role like Sr Developer
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:02:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
or something
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:02:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He could have admin + dev roles
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:03:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Part of me says give KIndal a warning that we are looking at slimming down the team and give him a week to prove his admin worth
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:03:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:06:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So I feel bad giving Cole a kick up the *** and not allowing Kindal that same opportunity
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:06:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:07:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)

⭐ **Staff Changes**

Hello @everyone, 

Firstly, I would like to congratulate you all on such a successful week here at KeyFM. We had a packed timetable for the majority of the week and it is all down to your dedication and commitment to Radio which is absolutely great to see!

If you didn't notice our team has grown exponentially in the past week, which is great to see! However, this means that we had quite a large amount of Radio DJs to a very small amount of Head DJ+. This resulted in some of you being left untrained, and we are attempting to change this. If you haven't been trained please send a message in <#710934799501754409> with the following format

```Name: 
Operating System (Windows/Mac/Linux):
Do you have prior experience with DJing?: Y/N 
```

If you ever need any help with anything at all, then please do not hesitate to contact your Head DJ, or Manager. If you don't understand how the Staff Panel or Rules work, then please contact the Management Team and they will explain them for you! 

Unfortunately, not everyone has completed their minimums this week. Please remember that Minimums are 3 slots. This left a large amount of our Radio team with one, two or three slots missing to complete their minimums. If you are a Guest DJ, you are expected to complete 1 slot a week. As an Ownership, we have decided that we will extend everyone's trial for an additional week, unless noted down below.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 18:47:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We will also be implementing a Review System & Staff Changes weekly. More information of both will be released in the not too distant future; however, I can confirm the times that Reviews & Staff Changes will be released every week which are:

```Reviews: Saturday @ 5pm BST
Staff Changes: Sunday @ 9pm BST
Timetable Reset: Monday @ 12am BST```

The Staff Changes this week are taking place on Saturday, here are the changes:

Craig, Tage, Wade, Fin ➡️  Radio DJ
Chance ➡️  Trial Head DJ
Bluey ➡️   Trial Extension. 
Zane  ➡️  Trial Executive
Olly  ➡️  Trial Executive 
Sam ➡️ Sr. Developer & Administrator 

Please congratulate them in <#704843393519452265>

If you’d like to maybe do some other stuff like look for some new admins managers and head djs that’s be great. Partnerships appear to be dead right now and we need help.

<@!212630637365035009> transfer me back the discord please
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sat Jun 13 2020 15:53:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
or give ownership back admin permissions
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sat Jun 13 2020 15:53:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
it is a shared discord and we should have access to add bots etc
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sat Jun 13 2020 15:57:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)
it isn't fair for you to have full control over everything we are all owners
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sat Jun 13 2020 15:58:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
all i did was take away bot perms
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sat Jun 13 2020 15:58:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
well add them back
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sat Jun 13 2020 15:59:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
figured it wasn’t a perm u needed
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sat Jun 13 2020 15:59:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and also you said you'd give me ownership of the discord
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Sat Jun 13 2020 15:59:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Parker (212630637365035009) at Sat Jun 13 2020 16:08:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
no it’s a scam bot which people think we are stupid enough to have in our server
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 13 2020 16:34:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Tbf we can just request if we want a bot
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 13 2020 16:35:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
As dev, parker should have final say which bots come on the server

TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:31:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
its cheap and can get us out there a lot more
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:31:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We dont have licensing tho
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:31:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
so that is a severe risk
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:31:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)
at getting us taken down very easily
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:32:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)
hmmm kinda but also not
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:32:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
we can age range it
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:32:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and make sure its safe
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:32:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
for us to use
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:32:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
its not like we are aiming for 40 year olds
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue Jun 16 2020 17:32:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I personally think it's a huge risk but up to you guys

Juulia (187019416867831808) at Wed Jun 17 2020 00:18:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It’s not his radio
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 00:18:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He's like telling me who I need to get rid of
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 00:18:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 00:18:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I've ran radios for long enough to know whos valuable and who isn't
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Wed Jun 17 2020 00:18:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
What are his suggestions 😂
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 00:18:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Apparently we should fire Zane according to him

I-

Zane is doing so much
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 00:19:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
No wonder Callum's radio's flop if thats who he goes round firing

ChrisJSYToday at 01:20
Because we need to make team sizes somehow...
Ik you have experience - hence, why I wanted to bring you in as Admin
but I am kinda offended at how much you are deciding to imply that i'm shit at running radios
CallumToday at 01:22
If that's how you wanna take the truth, take it that way. I can advise ways on how your team can be made better? But there's only somethings I can do to help as I know you have very stubborn opinions.
ChrisJSYToday at 01:22
I am not a very stubborn person tbh but ok
CallumToday at 01:22
With your opinions you seem to be
ChrisJSYToday at 01:23
Whatever.
I'm not really up for having this conversation because I actually respect you and think you could have been valuable if I moved you up positions but you have kinda taken this as a dig opportunity tbf.

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 00:49:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and I ask you to reconsider your stance on not wanting the promotion

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 15:30:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
**To-do List**
- Completely fix Radio Player (Top Priority)
- Rebalance the HDJ+ team (Look outside Radio if needed)
- Put better guidance in place for new DJs
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 15:31:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)
<@!212630637365035009> - I've been in touch with Aaron, he said that they are currently using a downloaded version of the player but they would prefer to use our Script if we can make it collapsible or maybe completely movable instead (like boxed instead of 'attatched to the top')
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:14:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Ok i can do that

<@!201124404254605312> What would you like to work on in the coming weeks? Me, <@!187019416867831808> and <@!147751463907622914> seem to have our own little niches but I've just seen a lack of activity which is fine I get it corona & stuff but we were all kinda just wondering what you'd like to work on yk
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:39:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
<@!212630637365035009> Hmmm i want to definitely work on more radio side of things get my self out there more... maybe get some more ideas for the site and panel
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:43:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You can definitely get involved with that stuff but you need to be self-motivating. We have had people come to us and say they haven't even see you around which obviously isn't ideal.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:43:51 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So maybe try to just engage in chats more etc.
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:45:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)
yep of course, sorry just had a bit of downer really gonna be more active 😛
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:46:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's not an issue obviously if you aren't feeling great but also that is stuff we should know, not necessarily the details but just that you aren't going to be around much
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:47:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Because when we make team decisions, we want to involve you but we are also not really able to wait all day if u get what i mean
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:47:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)

and then we had a week where our DJs were kinda not DJing but I think we've kind of got it under control

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:50:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Parker (212630637365035009) at Mon Jun 22 2020 21:47:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Whenever we get a v0.1 up that can sustain news. Is he not coming till news?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 22 2020 21:48:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He seems to prefer to come when we have news up bc that's kinda his thing

Hello Radio Department.

You have probably seen my message in Department announcements, but I just want to make this clear to you guys as it isn't relevant to Media. 

Last week a few arguments had occured over slots. Either because someone ticked way too early or because someone didn't tick it in time.

Can I just make it clear that this is not acceptable. I know people are eager to do a slot, I am too at times. But don't treat it as a competition.

For our new Radio Presenters

Welcome! 

Your minimums are two slots per week.
Each slot is an hour long.
You can book a maximum of two slots per week.
You can book a maximum of one slot in a day. 

If you have any questions, message your team captain, or another Radio Mentor (these are the dark purple people). Alternatively, use the Radio DJ guide. (React with a :ATick: once read)

Clark

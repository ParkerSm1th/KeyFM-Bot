**Update** Just realised all of the power intros are named incorrectly. This will be fixed in the next bolster but in the time being, please edit the metadata to separate artist and song. ðŸ™‚

We will be getting these updated soon with new VOs and a fresh sound.

Please for now, I know it may be hard, but stick with what we have above.

<@&709132561783455826> **Hi** Just thought I would let you know that we have finally released the **new** imaging at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14v8iGTXhmvgYaFBhs8fRyG0qF23lQg1r?usp=sharing

**Please note**: The metadata for power intros has been corrected but I recommend to check using your software.

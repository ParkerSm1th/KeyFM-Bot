Doohill messaged me saying they wanted to resign bc they had to motivation to dj so could someone message them and see if they can sway them otherwise.

Doohill is posted away - they've lost motivation but i don't want to lose them as staff bc they are actually quite good and was loyal at Slur so will be loyal here.

@here as Chris is on leave and Olly is currently not with us, we are going to have to work extra hard on maintaining the efficiency of going through applications and making sure that every trial radio dj knows what they are doing in terms of set up and broadcasting. I know that there aren’t a load of us, but we just all need to do our part. Thank you (:

As a Head DJ you are required to do everything a Radio DJ does but also:

• Assist users with training via the <#710934799501754409> channel or via PM. This consists of helping them set up Sam Broadcaster (Windows) or AudioHijack (Mac) and consists of if not already done, setting their encoder up so they can be ready to broadcast. If they already do not know how to download songs or add them to their software to play on-air, you can assist them.
• Persuade the DJs to book slots so we have a variety of different DJs on-air.
• Answer any questions or enquiries DJs may have.

**Window resources:** https://Calum.biz/hffm/djstuff.html
**Mac resource(s)**: AudioHijack.

I personally would use Youtube MP3, so getting the URL of the YouTube link (ensure it’s audio) and pasting the link in https://flvto.com.

Another way is, DeezLoader (not sure if it’s still around but I’ll let you know soon if it is).
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sat Jun 06 2020 20:19:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
<@!560551616504266791> As your activity hasn’t exactly been up to scratch, we’re expecting a lot more from you especially when you’re Head DJ and we hope you can be a lot more active in the Discord and maybe on-air.
Chance (704052692170834011) at Sat Jun 06 2020 20:20:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I got deezloader on my computer and I think I got the installer for it.
Chance (704052692170834011) at Sat Jun 06 2020 20:20:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)

<@!278627940403773441> Just a suggestion but I think it would be better to do these at the end of the week not exactly the start, I understand giving them at the start but I don't think people should be allowed to complete them until the end of the week.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Tue Jun 09 2020 12:02:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
They are to be completed on the Saturday.
MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Tue Jun 09 2020 12:03:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Then say that, from my knowledge they can be completed at anytime. I would say Sunday TBH when the slots reset

<#721837954640642078> will be used for users that can complete slots but cannot complete 3 (so 1 or 2).

It will also be used for DJs that  will not be doing any slots in the week due to valid reasoning.

If you can't tell, we are seriously struggling right now so really glad to have you on board. Main focus rn is just motivating the DJs to do their slots basically
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Thu Jun 18 2020 13:44:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and setting up people who need to be set up.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Thu Jun 18 2020 13:45:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'll set you up with a panel one sec
QuinnTFP (143764319572721665) at Thu Jun 18 2020 13:46:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Thu Jun 18 2020 13:46:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yeah, I can send you a powerpoint I made.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Thu Jun 18 2020 13:46:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You'll pick it back up again real quick.

<@!704052692170834011> Why did you tell Hacker he was not ready to complete slots?
Zane (278627940403773441) at Thu Jun 18 2020 14:20:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I did.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Thu Jun 18 2020 14:20:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He might have done so too.
MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Thu Jun 18 2020 14:20:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Chance said to Hacker that then.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Thu Jun 18 2020 14:21:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He hasn’t been trained and it’s unfair for him to do any slots when he’s never DJed before and wouldn’t know how to use the application or software.
MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Thu Jun 18 2020 14:21:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He has been trained by chance.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Thu Jun 18 2020 14:21:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
When was he trained?
MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Thu Jun 18 2020 14:21:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That's what he told me, said he's got software and music ready.
MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Thu Jun 18 2020 14:21:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't know when but he said he was trained.

MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Sun Jun 21 2020 21:33:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So we aren't warning
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun Jun 21 2020 21:33:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Also if someone could check how many slots everyone has done and take note for the most slots competition we currently have going on
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun Jun 21 2020 21:33:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)

MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Sun Jun 21 2020 21:35:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun Jun 21 2020 21:36:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun Jun 21 2020 21:36:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)

MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Sun Jun 21 2020 21:36:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Zane (278627940403773441) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:50:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)

MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:51:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I think there is just a lot of people who don't set a pfp.
TheUpBeatGamer (201124404254605312) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:51:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)

MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Mon Jun 22 2020 17:52:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's not a huge deal TBH, does but I think we need to worry about other things then PFPs.

MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Wed Jun 24 2020 19:35:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
They haven't been trained properly yet
Charlie (129582501394907136) at Wed Jun 24 2020 19:36:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)
If they're a Trial DJ, shouldn't they just be let go if they post away?
Charlie (129582501394907136) at Wed Jun 24 2020 19:36:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
kinda defeats the purpose of "Trial DJ"
MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Wed Jun 24 2020 19:37:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)

MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Thu Jun 25 2020 01:15:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Looking for work IRL, Can't afford food and barely can afford rent. IRL has to take the priority atm.
MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Thu Jun 25 2020 01:15:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I think we need to consider, removing from team if it's that long.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Thu Jun 25 2020 01:15:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
let him take it, tbh
Zane (278627940403773441) at Thu Jun 25 2020 01:15:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
it’s his life issues so we respect and understand
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Thu Jun 25 2020 01:15:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We can't remove from team if he's basically saying he's going homeless.

Just wanted to explain to you guys that currently the listeners are low because we've been removed from HabMe for the time being. We're working our way to get back on there and I hope to be back on by 5pm. 🙂
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Fri Jun 26 2020 10:20:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That is not to be distributed to the DJs though for now, please.

Charlie (129582501394907136) at Fri Jun 26 2020 14:36:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)
"Busy with school and personal reasons."

**Slacking DJs have been warned** - making announcement shortly.

<@&704843393250885698> - Welcome to this chat. As you will see in <#726948319032508438>, I have added the roles <@&726949620189626378> and <@&726949724933980301>. The DJs in this chat will only get <@&726949620189626378> when they have said they feel confident with the broadcaster **or** have been set up by one of you guys. You will have to let a Manager know when you've done this so they can change the role <@&726949724933980301> to <@&726949620189626378> 🙂
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 29 2020 00:02:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
The DJs in the chat will be given 24 hours to say they have been Trained or otherwise, and after that I will be assigning you all one or more people to get in touch with and set up. Can you please let me know what software you use so I can assure I get you to train someone who uses the same operating system.

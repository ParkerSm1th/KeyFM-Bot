Causes a conflict of interest especially within the higher ranks. We are struggling to get commitment on slots let alone sharing staff.

That makes sense. I don't see why its just aqua and not all radio stations?

It isn't just Aqua.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue May 26 2020 19:18:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Other stations are being considered, such as probably UpBeat.

Can I talk about this later? I still don't think it's a great decision haha
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Tue May 26 2020 19:34:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I think we will probably decide on a case by case basis

i.e. if you have +5 reputation you can double job because you've proven yourself or something idk

@everyone Here are tonights Staff Changes which will be released at 9pm BST. Zane and I have discussed them this week due to the uncontrolled nature of the Trial System. This will be fixed for next week, when we will discuss results together. 

```:star: **Staff Changes**

Any Trial Radio DJs that haven't passed their trial yet have been given another week to complete their minimums. Otherwise, they will be dismissed. Please check your tags in the discord if you are unsure if you are a trial.```

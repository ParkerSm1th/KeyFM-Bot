Hey @everyone - It would be great to see some DJs live today! If you can just head over to the panel and book a slot or two, when you go live we will announce it in <#704843393255211084>!

@here Just a little poll: React with 👍 if you'd like to remove the only view once connection info and 👎 if you'd like to keep it. I don't mind removing it, I added it because we used it when we used to use radiPanel at slur but I don't mind removing it.

Hey @everyone. The last few weeks we have been SUPER relaxed on the djing front but after our splash page gets released tmrw and likes start getting counted we are going to start enforcing it a lot more. Please please please get your 2 slots per week (more is better and encouraged!). If you are a Trial DJ getting your slots done is essential to passing your trial. Hope you guys are excited about the splash page and your future here at Key! We are starting to look for Head DJ’s and Radio Managers. Helping out in the chat, djing, and resolving problems helps show us you are ready to be promoted 🙂

Hey @everyone,

Please do your best to message people and get them in the discord before the Splash launch tonight! We are really really excited about releasing it and would love to have a high listener count seeing the site. We would also love if anyone would like to go on after the Ownership at 10.30pm, keep the hype going for as long as possible! We have a Likes system implemented on the Splash page, so you can fight it out to be top of the Likes, who knows there may even be prizes 👀

@everyone **minimum slot requirements** 
hey guys from monday we will be putting strong minimums in place, if you do not complete **2** slots next week (and dont contact a manager early on and tell them why you can't) you will be **removed**

**information on the cash giveaway**
for those **completing 2 slot minimums** you can **ENTER** the giveaway by reacting with 💵 

*we will check your slot count before issuing the prizes, the most slots you do the more you get entered, for example: Olly books 3 slots, he is entered 2 times (because the minimum slots is one entry) which means he is increased in chances of winning!*

**Quick Reminder**
If you’re planning on leaving KeyFm, why would you though, please do let a Manager or Admin know. It’s highly frustrating when you leave without letting one of us know. 

A quick simple message is all it takes.

**Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening <@&709132561783455826>**

We've got quite a packed timetable today, but would love to hear some more of you on air today! Our partners, HabMe, are currently experiencing some issues but as soon as they're back, we expect our listener count to bounce right back! You could be streaming to many many people, live from KeyFM.

If you don't feel like streaming your tunes, why don't you go tune in either on HabMe or our main site. https://kfm.ooo/habfm/ or https://keyfm.net/ 

Have a good day! 🙂
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat May 30 2020 14:10:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun May 31 2020 09:01:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
@everyone There is now a **Streamer Panel**, it is not complete yet but when you are live you will get a notification on the panel or you can click the page on the navbar to be able to access it. Everything is all in one place there for you, listeners, peak, time left, likes, requests, update dj says, *listener history (coming soon)* the next DJ along with their Discord for NWC, and more if you guys have any suggestionns ( <#714917230982463649> )!

If anyone is really good at building on Habbo Retros, please get in touch with me. I would quite like us to build a 'Party Room' on HabMe so that when people are tuned in they can come to that room and the DJs will be there too (where they can be!) 🙂

Hey @everyone 

I just wanted to put a **huge, huge, huge thank you** to all of you for all of your hard work over the past couple of days. I know it must feel like we have went from  30/40% to 100% very quickly but you have all been amazing at adapting and we can't wait for you guys to keep up the good work.

A huge thank you specifically to <@!389814391694163969> (who is now the first DJ ever at KeyFM to get 30 likes in one slot) and to <@!700383091851526206> (who is keeping the hype going by providing a stern competition that has made it a lot of fun - although he is kind of failing miserably right now ahaha #TeamJak). 

Another thanks to <@!212630637365035009> who has been so instrumental to how far Key has gotten so far, you know how brilliant you are and honestly, we wouldn't have gotten anywhere without you. Another huge thanks to <@!278627940403773441>, <@!264617372227338241> and <@!443429760467730432> who have really been working really hard on the radio quality side of things!

Finally, Welcome to all the DJs that have joined us from HabME. You will be instrumental to the future of the station. Thank you also to <@!501794697677635587> who has been so supportive throughout the entire process despite teething issues.

You guys are amazing! Lets keep it up.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 01 2020 01:18:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
There are so so many of you to name, I could go on and on and on. Please do not get offended if I did not mention you. Our whole team is GREAT. These are just some names that have **particularly** stood out but I could have literally put any single one of you down here...

Hey Everyone,

I just wanted to inform you all that I am taking **temporary** leave from KeyFM.  I am currently not in the right place to lead the radio with some personal issues and some recent radio drama - I will return as soon as I see fit. Please know that my DMs are **open** and that we have a **very** competent ownership team in Elliott, Julia and Parker. We also have a more than competent administration. Please trust them. Please note that this does **not** affect the partnership with HabMe, and I know that we maintain the full support of the Ownership. 

Please note that distribution of this message outside of the Staff Channels of this discord or Staff Chats in HabMe will result in warnings being issued. (aka this is not the type of thing to be posting on drama discords).

It has been an Administrative and Ownership decision that if you’re wanting to join the media team, you **must be over the age of 15** and you will be required to **pass a grammar test where you must get 3/4**.

_Users who are under the age of 15, will immediately and effectively be removed from the media team and they may continue to fulfil their duties by DJing._

⭐ **Staff Changes**

Hello @everyone, 

Firstly, I would like to congratulate you all on such a successful week here at KeyFM. We had a packed timetable for the majority of the week and it is all down to your dedication and commitment to Radio which is absolutely great to see!

If you didn't notice our team has grown exponentially in the past week, which is great to see! However, this means that we had quite a large amount of Radio DJs to a very small amount of Head DJ+. This resulted in some of you being left untrained, and we are attempting to change this. If you haven't been trained please send a message in <#710934799501754409> with the following format

```Name: 
Operating System (Windows/Mac/Linux):
Do you have prior experience with DJing?: Y/N 
```

If you ever need any help with anything at all, then please do not hesitate to contact your Head DJ, or Manager. If you don't understand how the Staff Panel or Rules work, then please contact the Management Team and they will explain them for you! 

Unfortunately, not everyone has completed their minimums this week. Please remember that Minimums are 3 slots. This left a large amount of our Radio team with one, two or three slots missing to complete their minimums. If you are a Guest DJ, you are expected to complete 1 slot a week. As an Ownership, we have decided that we will extend everyone's trial for an additional week, unless noted down below.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 06 2020 20:00:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We will also be implementing a Review System & Staff Changes weekly. More information of both will be released in the not too distant future; however, I can confirm the times that Reviews & Staff Changes will be released every week which are:

```Reviews: Saturday @ 5pm BST
Staff Changes: Sunday @ 9pm BST
Timetable Reset: Monday @ 12am BST```

The Staff Changes this week are taking place on Saturday, here are the changes:

Craig, Tage, Wade, Fin ➡️  Radio DJ
Chance ➡️  Trial Head DJ
Bluey ➡️   Trial Extension. 
Zane  ➡️  Trial Executive
Olly  ➡️  Trial Executive 
Sam ➡️ Sr. Developer & Administrator 

Please congratulate them in <#704843393519452265>

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 08 2020 17:52:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Hey everyone,

Just a reminder that if you choose to leave Key (which you shouldn't, because why would you?) - Please let one of the Managers+ know. It is extremely inconvenient when you just leave and don't tell us. It poses a **huge** security risk.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 08 2020 21:03:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Hi everyone,

Just so you know - My course is resuming tomorrow so I will not be available as freely as I have been the past few months. Issues should always be raised in the direct line of ranks, so it shouldn't really change much in terms of your interactions with me but if it does have to get raised to Ownership, especially during the EU day, please expect longer response times. Thank you! 🙂 

Radio DJ  ➡️  Head DJ  ➡️  Management ➡️  Administration ➡️  Executive ➡️   Ownership.

Over the years, we've had some pretty good memories making songs throughout different stations. I've sucessfully made 2 staff songs, HFFM - All I want for christmas & Bounce - SOS.

Should **we** make memories and make a KeyFM song together? Vote!

**The review system is now in place and running...**

As the review system is now in place and coded (cred. Parker). Your review will be given to you via the panel on **Saturday @ 5pm BST**.

**What is a review?**
It’s in the name, duh.
• A review is a formal assessment for a staff member and is feedback on how a user has done in the week.
• A review consists of the rating (1-5 stars), content (includes positives + improvements for the upcoming week).
• Reviews are always anonymous. 
• If a user feels as if their review is unfair, Administrator or higher is to be contacted.

**Who are reviews written by?**
• Senior Staff (Head DJ)
• Management
• Administration
• Ownership (ooo!)

||@everyone||
Zane (278627940403773441) at Tue Jun 09 2020 12:11:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
**Gold (5/5)** - You have achieved more than expected of you and shown high amounts of effort.

**Green (4/5)** - You have achieved what is expected of you and have shown a good amount of effort.

**Blue (3/5)** - You have not achieved what is expected of you but you have shown some effort.

**Red (2/5)** - You have not achieved what is expected of you and you have not shown any effort.

**Grey (1/5)** - You are posted away. A review hasn't been written for you this week.

Hey all. It has been an administrative decision for us to not announce staff changes this week as users or staff have been extremely busy this week, which is understandable.

The staff changes will be announced next week (Sunday 21st). It will consist of all trials either passing their trial or failing and general staff changes.

<@&709132561783455826> Guys we have **53** listeners right now and NO ONE is on air. Please please please someone cover this slot it’s a great time to go live and to interact with listeners.

Also: If you guys have a problem with your review do **not** discuss it in staff channels it will result in a negative point. You should be messaging a manager+ about it.

⭐ **Weekly Update**

Hello @everyone,

Sadly, I can not start on the same positive note that I had last week when I last made an announcement. Last week, I congratulated you all on such a successful week of DJing here at KeyFM. We had booked over ¾ of the potential slots and we were definitely on the right path to achieving everything & more at the radio. It was all down to your dedication and commitment which was absolutely great to see. I am not able to say the same about this week, and I have been prompted to make this announcement because the slot count last week was actually quite atrocious. 

Unfortunately, this week, most people did not complete their minimums. Please remember these are 3 slots a week if you are a Radio DJ or 1 slot a week if you are a Guest DJ. This left an absolutely huge, gaping hole in our timetable for the whole week. Some of you will have your reasons, I'm sure and some of you have taken the time out of your day to message one of my amazing team of Head DJs and above to tell them that you will not be able to complete slots for various reasons, I commend you for that. If you can not complete slots, you **must** inform a higher member of staff so that they can either negotiate your minimums for the week or excuse you completely from doing slots for this week. (**Please note that you will only be excused for 1 week and then you must ask again to be excused**).
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 15 2020 23:25:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I know there are a few members of HabMe within the staff team, I appreciate your support so much. For those of you who are members of the HabMe community, we’re so glad that you have joined us but especially to those of you who are management at HabMe, for sticking with us this past week when the slots have not been adequate by any means. I want to publicly let the DJs know that the inactivity within the team has bought them so close to abandoning us, but they have been so kind in staying around whilst we try to resolve this! I know your patience is running thin, but all I can do is plead for you to stick with us whilst I try to resolve this.

We have an amazing team here, everyone is so capable as a DJ. Please show us this in the upcoming week. 

Thanks,
Chris.

Hey @everyone ,

I want to be completely transparent about the situation over the past couple of weeks so here we go! First of all, I would like to give a massive thank you to <@!700383091851526206> who has stepped down from Executive in place to become Radio DJ. You think he's done a lot for the radio already, and you don't even know most of the stuff he has done. Most of you will know about his new venture, i'm obviously not going to mention it here but best of luck, Olly, we wish you every success but will miss your impact on the team greatly. 

As many of you will know, over the past week, the slot count hasn't been very good. This is down to a multitude of reasons that are mainly to do with the structure of the radio as a whole. We do not have a balanced HDJ+ team, we need more people to step up to the plate. We can't offer these positions out for free though, so you really do have to show that you are worth it and you will be rewarded. 

I know it's hard to be motivated when you see the listener count currently but we can only promise this will increase soon, but it will only increase if you all do your part. Our relationship with HabMe, although great, is running thin. We really need to step up our game as a family to improve and keep them on side. We realise that this isn't a job and you all have your personal lives as well but wherever and whenever you can, please try to keep us in mind and try to book at least 3 slots a week and doing more where possible.

In light of this, over the next two and a half weeks, whoever books the most slots will win £10/$10 through PayPal. Some terms to this are obviously completing your minimums (so if no one completes their minimums, there won't be a winner, but i'm sure that won't be an issue). Good luck & get booking. This competition closes on Sunday 5th July. Good luck!

We value every single one of you here and really want to make some promotions, so please give us reason to do so.

Hi! I just want to send a quick announcement about the panel, if you change your Discord username could you please tell someone at Management or above, if I try to message you and can not find you I will think that you have left KeyFM so please let us know if you have changed your Discord username.

Hey @everyone , 

A lot of you were interested in doing that Staff Song so let's get going with that! Just a reminder that we aren't expecting you to be the Ariana Grande or Shawn Mendes of singing, you literally could have no musical ability for all we care! It's just a bit of fun! I've got a few songs in mind which I will list below, and then we can have a vote on them.

1️⃣ Watermelon Sugar - Harry Styles
2️⃣ If the World Was Ending - JP Saxe & Julia Michaels
3️⃣ Sunday Best - Surfaces
4️⃣ I don't like any of these! (Please message me a suggestion).

Let's join together as a community & staff team to make something fun!

Hey everyone,

Just to let you know due to a bit of bad blood that is currently occurring between Key and Olly's Radio, double jobbing between these two stations has been **disallowed**. If you are a member of staff at Olly's radio, please message myself or <@!278627940403773441>. 🙂

Hey guys,

I’ve made a channel called <#723628074645585932>. I’d like if **every** staff member could leave one of the main reasons which holds you back from doing slots. @everyone
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 19 2020 20:07:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
^ i’m also using this as an activity check, everyone who doesn’t post will be receiving negative points.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sun Jun 21 2020 02:06:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
@everyone Hi guys!!! So if you are currently someone who has messaged a HDJ+ about slot-arrangements aka u can't do ur slots this week or next week or you are "posting away" for an extended amount of time. Those entries are now **void**. We have a new system called Posting Away & it's on the panel. Please use this link: https://staff.keyfm.net/panel/Staff.PostAway or just go to the panel, Staff > Post Away and enter your return date along with the reason to submit a post away request. A HDJ+ will either accept or deny your post away request and you will be excluded from minimum reminder messages, you will be excluded from not completing minimum slot negative points, and you won't be messaged by HDJ+ about completing your slots. 

Once it is the return date you will be automatically un-posted away and will be expected to do slots again so please make sure to book when you come back. 

**If you fail to do this on the panel, you will be given the punishment for not completing slots as normal, please do this everytime in the future.**

**ONLYFANS**
*now that I’ve got your attention, here’s what I’m actually talking about:*

Hello there everyone! Since I’m new to the Key community, I thought I’d introduce myself;

I’m a little British gay boy who’s been picked out by the lovely Chris to get the Community started, then eventually switch to News when that gets going (hopefully soon!)

I lead UpBeat’s news department (probs broken every rule by mentioning their name but oh well) for quite a few years before leaving to focus on schoolwork. I’m not a particularly cocky person, however I took the department from 5 staff to 40+ people and 30+ articles a week. My aim to try and get Key’s News department to that level, if not even better (if I’m not mistaken this place is a lot better than UB!).

Part of my philosophy in these positions is that I must earn the trust and support of those who I am meant to lead. I work for all of you, I’m here to support all of you and I will always ensure that I carry your voice and your concerns up to the Executives and Owners and will work as hard as I can to make sure everyone is happy here at Key. If you ever have any concerns or even a simple suggestion, please do not hesitate to DM me, I don’t bite (usually). I also have basically no life so if you ever wanna chat I’m here.

I am absolutely thrilled to be here. I love the vibrance and the team spirit that I’ve seen just within the first few minutes of me walking in here. I cannot wait to work with you all, and here’s to Key!

Hello! As y’all know I’m Julia and I run the Social Media’s of KeyFM along with the media team (pls apply if you’re 15+). I am looking to start to make our Instagram more interactive and reflective of Key. In doing this I would like to ask all of you to PM me a photo you would like posted along with answers to all of these questions:
1. DJ Name
2. Current KeyFM rank
3. Favorite Genre of music and Song
4. Favorite part of the radio community
5. A fun fact about yourself

Eventually, everyone will be getting a *staff highlight* post on Instagram. We just want to showcase every one of you because you make this happen and we wouldn’t be here without you (: Thank you so much

**WEEKLY SHOWS**

Hello all, first announcement from me - hope you are all well!

Anyways, there's been quite an interest for permanent Weekly Shows to be happen, and I can assure you that Parker is working on sorting that out on the panel and website.
In the meantime, I've made an Interest/Suggestion/Ideas form for you all to fill out, so if you're interested in having your own Weekly Show, you should definitely fill this form out!

We will hopefully have them all sorted in the next few weeks, so make sure you get your ideas in asap!
We would ideally like you to not be on Trial, but you can still suggest ideas, and if you pass your trial, your idea may be brought to the radio soon!

Please ping me or message me if you have any questions! :D

If you are wanting a weekly show, please feel free to discuss your ideas with me before submitting your idea. 
We can discuss times, themes etc and try to get the best possible chance of the show happening!
As for any voice overs anyone wants, please do not order any before the show has been approved by myself!

Hey @everyone.

I just wanted to say a huge **thank you** to all of you who went live throughout yesterday and the early hours of this morning. It was an absolutely stunning effort from everyone involved and was definitely the **best** day we've had on record so far.  We had DJs for the vast majority of times between 12pm on Saturday until 8am this morning.  These are the sort of weekends we should definitely be aiming for more often!  We are currently experiencing some downtime, we expect to be back soon but when we are, it would be great to book the rest of the day! 🙂

I also wanted to give a huge shout out to <@!188024274429149185> although I was asleep when their slot was done, I got some very good feedback from the Owner of HabMe about how well they did in their first slots at the radio. The owner pointed out that they were especially proactive in engaging with the HabMe community, which is something that we love to see and would like to see all of you doing more often. Why don't you hop on the retro whilst your DJing? You don't even have to play, just sit there and let people ask for songs through the client or just talk with them! Maybe even join their discord server, and  engage with them through that way?

@everyone **Minimums this week**
The slots this week has been amazing, we have had pretty consistent bookings and you have stayed with us through the attacks, which I all thank you for.  
Just a quick reminder on what you are expected with the amount of slots, per day and per week. 
```md
- No more than 2 slots in a row. This can be altered under Management's Discretion.
- Maximum of 4 slots a day (can do more to cover or more if free slots are available).
- Minimums are 3 slots a week.
```

If you have no completed your minimum slots this week you would have been given a `-3` point. DJs who have only joined this week have not been warned.

‚≠ê Update from the Ownership ‚≠ê 
Hello @everyone,

As an Ownership Team, we just wanted to acknowledge the leak to the general public of a photo that contained our Staff Panel, namely the 'Request Line' feature that we were due to add to our site very soon. We would like to reiterate that KeyFM is not attempting to engage with any drama that has become so synonymous with the Radio Community and as expected, we refute any claims that the work on our Staff Panel is not that of KeyFM and the claims that code on the staff panel have been stolen come with no reputable credit. 

Parker is a very hardworking developer that has been part of the Radio Community for many years now, he has worked with many radios in order to help them to achieve the websites that they wish for. He has a high reputation that should not be tarnished by the spread of any false information. All code found on our Staff Panel is by him or used with authorisation from the creator. If authorisation was needed, this authorisation was always sought before the use of the code.

We would like to reiterate that if you have any sort of interest for the Radio Community, any damage that you bring against any of the radios open today (whether it be us, Rise etc.), is putting the community as a whole into further disrepute. It does not reflect badly on the radios you are targeting. Many small radio communities such as us have been targeted extensively by DDOS attacks, no one looks at that and is proud of what is happening.

We are all in great times of uncertainty with this COVID-19 pandemic engrossing the world, places like KeyFM should be a place to retreat from that all - please treat it that way for the sake of us, and of the other small radios out there.

Thank you,
Chris
(On behalf of the KeyFM Ownership)

‚≠ê Administration Changes ‚≠ê 
Hi @everyone,

I just wanted to let you know that we have bought in <@!278627940403773441> as a Trial Administrator. We know that this could cause confusion between some of you considering recent events; however, I would like to reassure you all that we have had very constructive talks with Zane since the issue and come to multiple agreements as to how he can work with us to ensure the growth of KeyFM. Usually, our newly set promotion rules would not allow such a promotion to happen; however, this time they have been relaxed for good purpose. We have to remember that it is very early stages in the radio and if any person particularly impresses, they will be considered for vacant roles, even if they do not fit the general promotional changes that we allow. If you have any queries, please direct them to myself.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Tue May 12 2020 22:01:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
<3 I look forward to be working with an amazing team.

We are delighted to inform you that our Splash Page will be releasing this Saturday! Please tune in throughout the day for a variety of DJs live, playing all the greatest hits. The Ownership Team will be going live from 9.30pm BST for the launch and there will be a Warmup Show starting at 8pm. More details to come closer to the day! üôÇ

‚≠ê **Slash Release Today!**

Good afternoon @everyone ,

First of all, excuse the tag please! We try to limit tagging you all but on occasion we may! üôÇ 

We are so glad to announce that our Splash launch will be going ahead as planned tonight, and here is the schedule for tonight! Please remember, this is open to change as we get closer to the time due to logistical reasons.

**Warmup Show** - DJ <@!700383091851526206> 
Olly will be setting up the night with an amazing hour of DJing! Tune in from 7pm BST - 8pm BST for some of the best tunes from one of our best DJs here at KeyFM. You won't want to miss it!

**Countdown Show** DJ <@!418731339257348096> 
Mystikal will be taking over from Olly at 8pm BST, and if you have listened to one of his slots before, you will know that you can not miss this one! Mystikal will be on air until 9.30pm BST, and we can't wait to hear what he has planned! 

**Launch Show** <@&704843393255211079> 
Finally, the Ownership Team will be going live for the launch of the Splash Page. They will be live from 9.30pm with the launch expected around 10pm BST. You won't want to miss it, it may be one of the best splash pages yet ;)

**Note** We would like to thank everyone for their support over the past couple of weeks, we can't wait to grow as a community and remove this stigma that currently surrounds small radios such as ourselves. We would love if you were all to tune in tonight and join us for our Splash release!

üçæ **Giveaway Time**

We have just reached 100 members in our discord but we are not happy yet! Lets continue the giveaway spirit in style and although it may not be as big of a Cash Prize as HabMe (who are giving away ¬£50 tonight, make sure to check them out between 8pm and 2am on `https://kfm.ooo/habme/`) but we are giving away ¬£10 PayPal Cash Prize once we hit 300 members. If every person here just invited 3 other people, we could smash that target! 

Everyone will be automatically entered to the giveaway once if you respond with this ü•≥ emoji below! However, you can gain 1 extra entry for every single person who joins the server from your invites! They must stay in the server for the entry to count. 

Please make sure to use your own invite link & good luck!

@everyone**Happy Pride Month** from KeyFM

This topic (as a gay man) means so much to me. 

The first sign of LGBTQ+ Rights movement was decades ago, and trust me people fought. After laws were introduced to make homosexuality illegal, we fought and fought until we made a difference and had them laws overturned.

2020 is a great year to live in, our rights as LGBTQ+ people are equal to heterosexual or 'average' people. We can only thank those who fought for years.

We want to THANK everybody who feels comfortable enough to give expression of their LGBTQ+ identity & the supporters of the community, those who fought alongside us. We will forever accept you, forever love you and forever give you equal treatment. 

#HappyPrideMonth, for all those brave fellow LGBTQ+ members; we will have a pride logo on our server for the entirety of the month.

Alongside this, the current issues of the world means that it's not only our rights that we need to look at, we all understand the death of George Floyd. Please make sure your thinking about his family and the issues of equality across all sectors of the world this month. We need to work together, as a community, as one.  Black people fought the most emotional overwhelming journey to recieve equal rights and still have major issues. Please make sure this month you reflect on how you treat everybody & make sure your voice is heard. Black lives **MATTER**!

<a:rainbowsheep:585567947662032897> **Discord Bot Released!** <a:rainbowsheep:585567947662032897>

Hii so based on the survey I've decided to release out discord bot. Please please please add it to y'alls servers, not only is it a nice bot which allows you to stream our radio in any discord channel but it also allows you to check stats and the now next later. Once we get to 100 servers we become a verified discord bot and that'd be great! üôÇ 

A few things to note:

¬ª There **will** be bugs when this first comes out, they will be resolved soon though and please put them in <#719697641738600479> so I can see

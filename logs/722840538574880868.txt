Hi @everyone - I just wanted to make this chat so we can discuss how to move the radio forward after the recent issues. We all know that this past week has not been acceptable by any means and I think we just need to go to the drawing board and think together as a team to how we can solve this.  I have invited Aaron here to talk with us about how he thinks things are going, how he thinks we can improve etc and just to show him how seriously we are taking these recent issues. I know a lot of suggestions in here we won't always agree with each other, but it goes without saying that we have to stick together as a team right now and keep civil please.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 15:52:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Aaron has also been Sr Admin at HFFM and ThisHabbo, so he brings a wealth of experience to this talk.

Evening.

Hello
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 15:53:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Hey! I'm not sure if everyone is around yet but we can always just brainstorm and they can look back later.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 15:56:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That's fine, 100% fine. I've got some idea's you need to enforce in order to make sure that the radio is running to a full potential outcome, the way I see things right now... it won't be around much longer should things continue like this I hate to say. So, follow the following the best you can:

- Cash Prizes; Make sure people feel motivated in order to DJ, instead of saying "would you like?" just say we're running a compertition, person who does the most slots can win a cash prize this week!

- Senior/Head DJs; Have the team feel like there's something to progress too... at the moment it's standard Radio DJ/Radio Management from what I can see so have a role where Senior/Head DJ's can actually work up the ladder acting like an assistant RM?

- Development issues: I've personally requested a drop down closure on our client radio player for two weeks now, and i'm still waiting for this to be completed? How do you expect anyone to have any faith with quite frankly a lagging development team?

- DJ Training: Speaking with a few people you've brought in from HABMe, they've been set up a panel account and have no real knowledge on how to DJ, hence no slots being booked? This is your shortfall as your management is dedicating time to training them, however not completing this task.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 15:57:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Okay let me just read through that and make a few comments 🙂
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 15:59:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Also, the ownership. Everyone here has different goals/outcomes for KEYFM from what I can see, I speak to one person who seems like they really want this to work, and then I speak to someone else and it feels like they don't care, or have different views on where the site should be going.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 15:59:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
If you really want shit to work, you all need to be singing from the same hymn sheet, and frankly you're not. =
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:01:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
- Cash Prizes: I agree on this, I think it's very difficult to keep DJs motivated now-a-days. It's definitely the best and most effective way to make people do things when they have a cash incentive. 

- Senior/Head DJs: We do have this role; however, there are a lack of DJs proving themselves worthy of the position. We currently have Chance in the position, but we wanted at least 2 more. 

- Development Issues: I agree, there is definitely a lag on the development side of things. It is not helped by the fact that Parker is the sole developer and he is currently enrolled in Summer School which obviously does take a priority over Key. 

- DJ Training: I think this has manifested from the issue of a lack of HDJ, Managers and Admins. I have put forward a restructure as i've said to you, but it did rely on Olly and Callum which is a situation that i'm still trying to fix. 

- Ownership: Again, agreed to some extent. I feel all of us have a common goal that we want it to be successful but we don't have a laid out timeline of where we want to be so expectations differ between us. I know for example that I am extremely passionate about this working out and I am willing to put so much energy into it.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:02:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That situation is fixed, and I could have that sorted in 10 mins if you allowed me time to do so.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:02:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But this ownership team is dysfunctional.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:02:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
There's far too many cheifs, not enough Indians.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:03:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And for the site to succeed, I hate to be horrible but i'd cut the ownership team in half... as not everyone here offers anything special.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:03:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And infact is dragging the site to it's knees.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:03:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I have no idea who <@!201124404254605312> is and i've never seen him on HABMe or speak in the discords to be honest, that's a person i'd cut first. Who is he? What does he do?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:04:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Not meaning to be rude, but the sites on it's arse.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:04:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I think everyone here is worthy of their place when they put the time in. I know <@!187019416867831808> and <@!212630637365035009> want to work so hard to try and achieve the best for the site but they both do have their commitments such as Work and Summer School.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:04:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yeah, but who's <@!201124404254605312>
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:04:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
What's his role?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:05:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Have no issues with the above two people, they do try their best and real life always should come first.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:06:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't know to be honest, we started the radio together and everyone made their commitments to do certain roles. Parker is quite obviously in charge of development, Julia is very good at community and peacekeeping, Elliott has been floating about with no real set purpose which may be a fault of the ownership not setting anything out for him to do in particular.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:06:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Get rid.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:07:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's a role not needed, and is making your team look messy.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:07:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
When you start having more management/admins/owners than actual staff, you have an issue.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:07:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Half of your upper management team do nothing in all fairness.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:07:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
A lot of them do quite a bit behind the scenes.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:07:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Zane for example.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:07:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Zane does a lot.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:08:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I fail to see where?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:08:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He makes a few announcements on discords basically shouting at people to book.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:08:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I mean, motivate them don't shout at them lol.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:08:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
No wonder they're not doing anything when you're sat there going "YOU MUST BOOK"
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:08:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He implemented the whole review system, put together every interview format for a start
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:08:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It should be enjoyable, not a full time job.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:08:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Review system should of been implemented by Radio Management
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:08:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We didn't have a functioning Radio Management at the time.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:09:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You still don't.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:09:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Joshy isn't a functional management member.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:09:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)
No one is suitable for the positions.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:09:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Sorry but there is your problem.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:09:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Your problem lies with upper management.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:09:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He was on the radio the other day and about for 10 mins he was on about what streaming serivce had moana on it or something.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:09:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So boring, bland.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:10:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Joshy was bought in by Olly, I didn't like standing in Olly's way because I know he is very capable.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:10:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
The other day, I offered you guys a £30 budget between the hours of 8pm-11pm for live DJ's to use and giveaway as you wish.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:10:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Half of it was auto DJ.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:10:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It felt like i wasn't listened too at all.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:10:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And that my efforts was just blown over, even though I was offering to supply prizes?
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:10:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That is my fault. I had said I was going to get together people and I failed on that end. I apologise.
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:11:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So blame me for that
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:11:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Not blaming anyone for it at all.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:11:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But when i'm sitting here offering to give you guys £30.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:11:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And you cannot motivate 3 DJ's to book.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:11:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's worrying.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:11:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That's £10 per hour that could of been given away, which would of really benefited you guys and our community too.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:13:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It is a big failing on our behalf that we couldn't organise people for those three hours.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:13:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
By the way, Julia, please don't absorb any of the blame on yourself. It's a failing of the team, not of an individual.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:13:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
This radio player has had issues since partnership, we asked for the main source so we could use our radio player and failed to give that, we had to result to your radio player however it's still broken, still no closure for the box so it's creating issues on our client for audio volume for the actual game.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:14:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We added our own button, which allows users but breaks the radio when used.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:14:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But we've been asking for long enough, for frankly a job that would take 10 mins?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:14:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Parker told me "i'll do it tomorrow buddy" almost a week ago now, and we
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:14:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
are still waiting.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:14:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't know honestly why we're fucking about with jobs that can be sorted within mins.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And I don't want to be rude, I really don't.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I understand that.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I like you guys, that's why i'm giving you a chance.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But come on lol.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's frustrating for you, I completely understand.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Well, it's not just for me?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's your radio people can't tune into.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yeah, I know.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So it should be pissing you off too, because 80% of the hotel can't tune in?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It shouldn't be down to me, begging you to fix shit.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:15:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
If you want listeners and broadcasters to be motivated, it needs fixing, two weeks ago.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:16:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But still, we're waiting.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:16:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yes. The situations with the player have been odd though because there have been occasions when there are no issues and then new issues crop up.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:17:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Of course, but it shouldn't take two weeks to resolve a small issue.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:17:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Such as adding a button, where users can close the radio, and a button where they can re-open it again.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:18:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I’m the sole developer and truly have not had the time. Anytime I touch anything related to the radio right now is like restarting a bot which I can do from my phone. Parents are on my ass right now and I can’t risk getting in trouble. Not all of us can sit around all day and do this stuff, especially right now when things are tight.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:18:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We had an amazing radio player with requests/like the DJ right in game, and we asked for the original link to the broadcast so it would work for all, and <@!212630637365035009> failed to give us that information.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:18:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So honestly...
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We had a direct line for a http version
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
<@!501794697677635587> that is the original link
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm annoyed as my team did an amazing radio player, and was let down by you guys.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
that’s the only link
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Our provider didn't give us a https link
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
there isn’t another one
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's not the original link, i'm sorry but it's not.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It is? We have a deal with Shoutca.st which allows us to use our custom domain.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And your radio player didn’t work flawlessly.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:19:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Parker, i'm sorry but you could easily come online and add a close radio button within mins.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I really couldn’t actually
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Then, we're wasting time here.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm sorry but if this is the outcome, i'd be removing our partnership.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Because I have class?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You've had two weeks.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
To fix a three min issue?
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yes
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It’s not a 3 minute issue
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't hold any confidence in you.

Your rude.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I’m rude?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And quite frankly, it's your way or no way.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
What?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And your holding this ownership team to ransom.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
As they believe, you're the only one who could do something.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:20:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)
My advice, get a new developer.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:21:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We had a completely new player built by y’all which i didn’t want but i allowed y’all to do then you put ours back??
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:21:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Because you wouldn't give us a direct source.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:21:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I’m not holding them ransom? I’m not allowed on my computer?!
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:21:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Dude
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:21:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
there isn’t another source
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:21:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don’t think you get it
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:21:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We have CName records setup with shoutca.st
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:21:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Listen, I don't think you get it.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:21:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)
How fars your V1 into working?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)
To be fair, I've been on the centovacast we literally do not have any other links on there.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We had some going before I started my class? It literally ends in a week
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
At this rate, you'd be lucky to be open in a week.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You have a leak, and it needs patching.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Open what in a week?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)
This.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's crumbling mate.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm giving you advice.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Your taking it as a personal attack.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:22:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Wtf are u in
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Wdym personal attack?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Can't you see lol... you're relying on an Auto DJ mate.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I’m just frustrated bc u don’t understand that I have a real life
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I never said that.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I said above, real life comes first.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Did I or did I not?
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You’re upset about the client player not having the dropdown
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and as i’ve said
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Mate.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I haven’t had the time
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and that’s the truth
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm upset about a lot of things.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:23:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But the only thing you think about is yourself.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Not your team, who are spending money on keeping something alive, or trying too.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I’m sorry, What?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Parker spends money too btw
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)
While you PUSH everyone away with your stuck up, self centred attitude.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I pay for 95% it KeyFM
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm the only one that doesn't contribute financially.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Just to clear that up
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Scrap him.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'll pay it.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We don’t want you running our radio
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Then I don't want you in our partnership.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And how am I pushing everyone away lol
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I've been friends with Parker for years, I know he is dedicated to his projects.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So you just want to run our radio?
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You want our radio?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:24:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He is just having a tough time at home rn?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
No, I don't want your radio.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I want you guys to succeed.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And every way I turn with Parker, it's a personal attack.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And he takes insults from it.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
??
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So you’re saying you’d replace Parker
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don’t take insults
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't want to replace anyone.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But I don't want someone sitting there saying, I pay 95% of the site.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And thinking that's an owner/investors job done.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You said that the team pays for it
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and i do nothing
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You do nothing.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Honestly...
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:25:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm upset at the amount of time we've waited for a radio fix.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Almost three weeks to be exact.
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Hold on, excuse me, but what the fuck, hes done so much
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I can do it myself within 5 mins.
Juulia (187019416867831808) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Then fucking do it
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You clearly can’t
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Give me your codes.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'll do it.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Idk if u know what it looks like on your site right now lol

Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And i'll fix it.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:26:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Within 10 mins max.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Idk what you’re planning on fixing
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
The radio?
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Last time I checked when you guys did it
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That keeps tuning people out.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
On your player
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
it broke the whole thing
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
so
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Because, we've been waiting for two weeks.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You literally have access to the js
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
For a collapse radio button.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:27:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yes, bc I haven’t had the time. It’s like you keep missing this
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I said above.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Real Life comes first.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That’s the JS
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But if you're telling me you've not had "10 mins" spare in two weeks.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Try your best lmao
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Your having a laugh.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It’s not 10 mins though, and i’m not allowed on my computer from my parents
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)
it’s not like my choice dude
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:28:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I’m a junior I still have parents lmao
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:29:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We all have parents.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:29:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yea, and so when they’re not allowing me on my computer i’m not sure what you expect?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:29:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Well honestly, get another developer in?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:29:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So they can assist you with tasks/development.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:29:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
When you are NOT online.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:29:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't see why your taking it as an attack to you personally.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:29:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We have other developers but they do jack
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:30:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Then replace them?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:30:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Why you pussyfooting around people?
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:30:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don’t think you understand, when I say i’m not here that means i’m not here, not able to hire other people and show them how it works etc. It all works hand in hand.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:30:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Show them how it works?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:30:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Come on mate... stop pissing around.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:30:51 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Reread my message lmao
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:30:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I’m not around to show them
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:30:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
If you're hiring developers, you shouldn't need to "show them how it works".
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:31:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)
A developer would know how it works.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:31:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You have to show them how your site is structured and such?? And I need to send FTP details etc, it’s not as easy as just giving them the ranks and saying okay work
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:31:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Never said it was, but i'm sure someone here has access to the website?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:31:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And they can give that to a development member.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:32:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)
FTP access? No bc they aren’t developers. We’ve learned the hard way in the past that you have to be secure with your stuff as we’ve had whole sites deleted.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:32:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I’ve got to go, class is starting
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:32:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I've personally never thought of asking for FTP details as I don't need them.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:32:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Well, i've owned radios/websites and managed the biggest online radios too for Habbo.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And i'm telling you what you need to do to improve.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You've taken that as an attack, therefore nothing more I can say.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But this is KEYFM.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Not PARKERFM.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't think he thinks it's parkerfm
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't know, it seems this way.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)
If parker is away, no-one else can do anything.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
From what I can seE?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Honestly, ik he has the best interests of the radio at heart.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:51 GMT+0000 (UTC)
When i'm offline all my ownership team and SLT team.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:33:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Have access to the site encase anything happened.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:34:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So, i'm baffled to why you guys do not.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:34:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I mean, I wouldn't know where to start if there was an issue.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:34:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But he could assist you from mobile.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:34:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
This would stop issues such as this.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:34:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Where people are awaiting two weeks for issues to be fixed.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:34:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)
What if you was to be hacked tonight? Parker cannot get online for another two weeks?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You need to look at it more as a buisness, not a covid project.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Honestly, I would have zero chance of being able to do fuck all if anything happened even with direction.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm not good at any of that stuff.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm sure you guys want to make money.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We don't
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's a non-profit.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So why you selling advertising space then?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)
To cover costs.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
That's fair enough.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Plus some of the money goes to charity.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Charity?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:35:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)
What charity?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:36:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Depends on the month
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:36:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We don't give it to the same, plus we haven't sold any slot yet to be able to give any
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:36:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm seeing this more clear.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:36:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We have talked about our first one going to Trevor Project.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:36:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
If you're not covering your own costs.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:36:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
How can you chairty funds?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:36:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You need to be realistic.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:36:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Because Parker is happy to pay for it.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:37:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Supporting a charity is fantastic, I love the idea. Whoever did that should be fucking proud.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:37:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and Julia is happy to pay where she needs to
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:37:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and I will be once I get my job back.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:37:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But, if you're not covering your cost... it's an expense.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:37:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We said at the start we wanted to absorb that expense.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:37:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
This was started as a COVID project.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:37:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But long term, the money will run out.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:37:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You need to be covering costs.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:37:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And by bringing the radio to life, I know now that would work.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:38:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I know a few people on HABMe who would pay for advertising space.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:38:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
A few retro people/hosting people that would pay for it.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:38:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We really do appreciate your support, Aaron, we know you have the best interests of the radio at heart.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:38:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And i'm more than happy to do that.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:38:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I just really really have to ask that we have your patience on some issues, they will be ironed out. We will work on having a more functional dev team.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:38:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We will balance out the upper staff.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:38:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I have to be honest.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:38:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm going to have to be honest.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:39:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And i'm sorry to do this, as I know you're trying.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:39:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But i've spoken with my directors/ownership.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:39:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Ik what you're going to say - that's your choice.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:39:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And we're giving you 48 hours to try and resolve issues/radio problems, otherwise we're going to remove.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:39:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We have two further radios wanting to partership.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And I do want to assist you in getting back on track.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But... it doesn't seem like you want my help.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I've said so many times that we want your help.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So all I can do is offer 48 hours.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I started this chat because I wanted your help.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
However.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You're not agreeing with what's being said either.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So, there's a breakdown here too.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:40:51 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I don't agree on both halves.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Work top down, sort your issues out between ownership.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Get new Radio Management.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And sort it from there.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)
My advice.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We have no issues as an Ownership
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We are a team and friends.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Seems you do as you said you was "upset" with the outcome.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I feel that Parker is entitled to feel how he feels
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and I think your entitled
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
to feel how you feel.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm just gutted that you clash over it.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:41:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I mean, if this was anyone else I don't think they'd of been so understanding.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:42:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I do love you guys.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:42:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But you’re lacking
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:42:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We know we're lacking.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:42:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We've said that it's not acceptable and that we're trying to fix it.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:42:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We are limited though
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:42:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We need time.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:42:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
If you want to remove the player whilst issues are fixed, that is a choice you can make.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:43:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Upbeat do not treat their partners as well as we wish we could treat you when everything is working
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:43:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm just saying.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:43:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You will be cast to one side and treated like any other affiliate.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:43:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We are working **directly** with you.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:43:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)
No one else.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:44:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)
The grass may seem greener when there are the issues rn, but I can assure you in the long run it won't be.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:48:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
This is not upbeat mate
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:49:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You said two radios?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:49:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I was 99% sure one of them was UB
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:49:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and the other one is this new Olly one?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:51:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
One was Olly yesh
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:51:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Oh sorry, I assumed the other one was UB
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:51:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
because I swear I heard it somewhere
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 16:51:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
that's my bad ahaha
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 17:00:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
No ahah!
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 17:00:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)
They was asking but we said no haha
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 17:00:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Good
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 17:00:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
They're literally so bad to their affiliates.

<@!501794697677635587> I think we've managed to get it to work with the script.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 17:07:47 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Would you mind checking please?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Wed Jun 17 2020 17:07:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Parker sent me the code from his phone.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Wed Jun 17 2020 17:12:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Sure!
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 17:14:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You should just be able to add the scrip

I didn’t send him anything for that bc I can edit that if i sneak my computer tonight and it’ll update automatically, you should be able to drag the player now though

Make sure you clear cache and such and remove y’all code and just add the script tag.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 17 2020 20:37:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It’ll become draggable once it fully updates

Okay, that's a <@!212630637365035009> thing to look at. Do you like it being moveable so the players can put it wherever they like?
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Fri Jun 19 2020 01:02:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It really confuses me though because I was having the issue for a few days when we first put the player on and now I never get it anymore
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 19 2020 01:42:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)
<@!501794697677635587> Are you sure they were on the new player? Also: I didn’t make huge changes apart from the draggable because I can update anything now and it automatically does
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 19 2020 18:58:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Sure, I can add like the dj. and today we have yet to experience the drop so i'm assuming the code i pushed late last night has fixed the switch issue.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 20 2020 23:12:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)

And putting Joshy as Admin when you wasn't happy with him as RM is a weird choice, but i'll roll with it.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun Jun 21 2020 22:10:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He's upped his game recently, and we want him to feel valued because we know he can prove his worth even more in the future.

And just confusing really considering you wasn't happy with him, I don't feel he stepped up at all... I feel it's you guys who kicked some life back into KEY not him.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 21 2020 22:11:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun Jun 21 2020 22:12:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He is on a trial, as with every promotion, so i'll guess we'll see if he steps up to the plate anyways.

Our best guesses would obviously be either Rave (which is Olly's new station) or Aqua (who have been known to do attacks before, but no where near this level).
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Mon Jun 22 2020 01:23:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)

I had discussed with George the possibility of Head DJ quite some time ago and he said that he would have to think about whether he had the time. He came back to me today saying that he wanted to take me up on the offer, he has been doing hours of DJing weekly so if he just dropped down a couple of slots he would be able to do the workload easily and at the end of the day, it's his work load to balance and if he can't balance it, he will end up failing the trial and what do you mean about Charlie, was that in PMs?

Zane (278627940403773441) at Wed Jun 24 2020 20:57:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It is however, entirely up to them if they'd like to play though.

<@!212630637365035009> Yeah still dropping listeners - was at 51 after restart now 12 but no-one has closed off the hotel. Needs fixing as people are getting tuned ou.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 24 2020 21:55:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It’s not something that’s like fixable with javascript it’s more of the djs aren’t playing music as soon as they go on and so like it tries to reconnect them but sometimes cant. I’ll try to look and see if there is a chrome work around but i’m not sure if there is.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 24 2020 21:55:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Happens on normal radio sites but u don’t notice as much
Parker (212630637365035009) at Wed Jun 24 2020 21:56:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Hey just an FYI: Another retro is adding our radio link to their retro with a custom player, we told them we are exclusive to u guys though so won't be advertising them in anyway shape or form
KngToday at 5:50 PM
...
Not really happy about this.
ParkerToday at 5:50 PM
I can't stop it
there is no way to block an IP
I told him we only support HabMe
and wouldn't change our player for them bc we are exclusive to you guys
and that we won't allow any advertisement of theirs on our discord
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:51:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)

That we would be the only retro.

You are the only retro.

We have disagreed to advertise any other retros Kng.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:53:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We literally messaged the user to let him know we’re not advertising his radio, Kng.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:53:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)
All they are doing is putting our radio stream url and playing the music
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:53:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I was just letting u know that they are playing our music on their retro
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:53:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He still added our radio because he’s a friend of mine.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:53:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Not using our player or another
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:53:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We didn't ask him to add it

Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:53:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I just was trying to be open about the fact that he chose to add our stream which we didn't ask for.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:54:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Was trying to be transparent x
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:54:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We will continue to be exclusive to Habme, still advertise it and we will not be advertising any other retro.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:54:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Nah.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:55:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We'll be discontinuing.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:55:17 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Calensi is a good friend of mine and he agreed to us not advertising his radio as he respect the fact that we’re exclusive.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:55:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'll have this followed through.

<@!501794697677635587> Would you like me to research blocking an IP?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:55:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
No just don't bullshit.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:55:38 GMT+0000 (UTC)
What?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:55:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)
First it was we promise cash giveaways on the radio.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:55:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Second it would be, all our team will play HABMe daily.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:55:53 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Then third, "no other retro will have our radio"
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:56:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)
<@!147751463907622914> will talk here in the morning
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:56:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And you've got someone who wanted to hack us... on your team.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:56:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yeah, nice move.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:56:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We didn't ask them to use our radio
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:56:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We didn’t ask them to use our radio at all.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:56:33 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He added the stream URL himself, which is why we **denied partnership**.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:56:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'll let chris speak to you because sometimes we but heads and i'd rather Chris explain it to you.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:57:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We have literally denied many partnerships in respect for HabMe and the exclusiveness we offer.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:57:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I just don't think you get it.

Three promises you've made.

Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:57:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And tbh, you might be improving.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:57:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)
But i'm getting sick of hearing bullshit

Geo is exactly the same.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:58:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)
While we wait for chris I will research how to block their ip from accessing the radio link
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:58:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
If you can add him into the chat?

Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:58:31 GMT+0000 (UTC)
See how you like it?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:58:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
A partnership is just that...
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:58:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He can go on the radio at anytime, shouting join ZUBBO.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:58:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And your fine to allow that?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:58:50 GMT+0000 (UTC)

No he cannot.

Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 00:59:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You've obviously given him the retro code for the player.

Maybe if you focused on getting your player fixed <@!212630637365035009> you'd have good enough listeners as it is, considering it's still disconnecting users everytime it changes DJ's.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:04:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We sit at a stable 50+ online more than 20 hours a day, and your radio has 4/10 listeners.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:04:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)

I've tried over and over and I actually spent a good amount of time on code i'm deploying at midnight tonight, tested, even restarted radio server and as soon as it came back up everyone was reconnected. I've been putting work into this. I hope that was visible

he added his own player with our stream URL
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:16:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)

He clearly says "partnership" and parker asks for a link to the retro.

Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:17:19 GMT+0000 (UTC)
he never added our PLAYER (the one we coded).
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:18:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We didn’t think other radios having our retro player acted as a partnership.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:18:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You're radio has been removed.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:18:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He would of not been advertised, either.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:18:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We will discuss this matter tomorrow, with relevant parties.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:18:54 GMT+0000 (UTC)
The screenshot clearly states "partnership" and he asks for the link. He also asks for a banner.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:18:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
You've broken the TOS we had.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:19:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
The BANNER to add to his OWN PLAYER to represent KeyFM. We **never** agreed to a partnership.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:19:23 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'd prefer to speak to Chris.

Zane (278627940403773441) at Fri Jun 26 2020 01:37:04 GMT+0000 (UTC)
He still never add our player on his client.

But you told me above, you gave him no scripts and he made his own player and off his own back, wanted to partner with KEYFM?

I'm around for a text chat but not sure when I'll be free to go on a voice call.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 27 2020 15:56:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Honestly from what I've gotten from both parties, what happened just seems like a bit of a trust issue due to a miscommunication that occurred 2 nights ago. It would work best if you guys can speak in here about how you feel about the situation and I can mediate. We can add anyone you require into this chat.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 15:58:18 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Sure, when <@!278627940403773441> is free we will have a chat, same with <@!212630637365035009>
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sat Jun 27 2020 15:58:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I can respond it’ll just be a little delayed i’m babysitting 🤪
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 15:59:13 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So, what annoyed me the most is the fact you told me you never offered a partnership, and the screenshot explained different, you was asking for a retro link and sending him the radio player codes.
Parker (212630637365035009) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:01:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yes and I can appreciate that. The partnership that was a whole other story, the retro code i’ll be the first to say I should’ve been more open in saying yes I gave him the script link. I truly didn’t mean it malicious because if I had I would not of come to you in the first place transparently saying the Hey just wanted to let you know another retro has our stream url on their client.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:02:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I'm glad we're able to admit fault there, it certainly will go a long step in terms of being able to fix this. Of course we're not going to be perfect, so maybe clarity is something we need to work on in regards to that.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:05:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Just to put my 50 cents in - I don't think we were necessarily clear enough with Calensi. The chat logs should've easily displayed the fact that NO advertisement was going to be included by their choice to put the Radio on their retro. If anything, we thought it may be of an additional benefit to you guys as we still intended on allowing you to do all your slots where you frequently talk about HabMe (which is great), and the more retros that chose to just put our radio on their client (without any additional benefits, such as our advertisement), the better it is for the growth of your retro.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:06:41 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I know that one of your concerns was Calensi becoming a Radio DJ and essentially raiding on air. Just to clear that up, due to his history within the community, he would've not gotten onto our team.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:20:48 GMT+0000 (UTC)

I'm all for different partnerships, but not when you lie to me saying he did it off his own back.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:24:52 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I appreciate you giving us another chance and I do apologise for the misunderstanding. Unfortunately, I do agree that we were not being clear enough and it was slightly misleading; however, we never intended to cause any harm. Everything got a bit out of hand the other night, and I'm sure we can agree that stuff that was said, shouldn't have been said but it's best to just move on now.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:28:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:34:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Also Charlie or w/e his name is.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So fucking rude.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Thank you for giving us another chance - btw, we are looking into the Charlie situation.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:06 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We are currently speaking about it.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:09 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I tried having a chat to him, making bonds with him.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And he was like
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:14 GMT+0000 (UTC)
"the fucks it got to do with me"
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:16 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Etc.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:20 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Not happy with him in all fairness.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We'll surely get to the bottom of it and hopefully it will be solved.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)

ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:35:58 GMT+0000 (UTC)
And yes, we definitely do need to look into being more transparent. I think that always has been the cause of any sort of our disagreements or misunderstandings.

Because he was in the Radio Chat tagging me saying I should be on air.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:36:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:37:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
As you can see, I said to him "I was being polite, getting to know everyone etc".
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:37:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)

I'm going to be completely honest when I say I have been warned by people in the past that Charlie can be that type of person. I've personally never experienced it but I have known him for many years now.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:40:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)

We will obviously speak to him about the situation and how he should have dealt with it.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:40:40 GMT+0000 (UTC)
and issue warnings where appropriate.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:40:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Well, i just think he's rude and to be honest he added to the problem.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:40:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)

We're so glad you didn't, and we know sometimes it can seem like a lot but we have seen so many times where this partnership has worked very well.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 27 2020 16:42:08 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Zane (278627940403773441) at Sat Jun 27 2020 17:50:28 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We'll have to check and see where he is getting his songs from.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat Jun 27 2020 17:52:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Okay. I want to be completely clear on this. Would you like us to completely disallow other retros from using our radio stream,  or just not to do partnerships (i.e. Mutual Advertisement, Events etc)? I think it would be hard to stop radios using their own client player and just using our stream link but if we ever caught it, we could ask for them to remove etc.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sat Jun 27 2020 18:43:12 GMT+0000 (UTC)
They can use it, no advertisements or events.

bot spam is for bot commands that create spam

if there’s any confusion that are linked with questions, just refer it me or Chris / Parker.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sun Jun 28 2020 04:25:10 GMT+0000 (UTC)

Just wanted to mention something to you guys, Harvey is one of the best DJ's you've got, he's come in our discord, interacted with our community and actually reminded me the reason we partnered in the first place.

Please message him with some credit/award and trust me, he's stunning. Don't lose him.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sun Jun 28 2020 04:52:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I will be issuing him points!
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 04:52:35 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Many of your team don't even come on HABMe anymore, and he's actually made an effort.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 04:52:37 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Love it, really do.

We can certainly talk abt head dj with him eventually as well 😉
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:00:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Yeah, he's really good.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:00:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I was just wondering if you could advise your team to come on HABMe more?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:00:56 GMT+0000 (UTC)
As that was part of the partnership deal?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:01:03 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Just don't see many of the team online anymore, or encourage it.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:01:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Where possible.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:01:15 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Because I think more people would tune in if they interacted with the DJ if it was encouraged.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:01:21 GMT+0000 (UTC)
As it was at the start of the partnership? <@!212630637365035009>
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:01:43 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We can always advise it and encourage it whenever you need, indeed.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:01:55 GMT+0000 (UTC)

<@!501794697677635587> I have issued some points to Harvey for his hard work. Highly appreciated for the hotel alert for Harvey as it was his first couple slots here at KeyFM.

<@!212630637365035009> still having a few issues with people tuning in if we could re-look at the player when you have a spare 20 mins?
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:10:22 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Thanks as well for sorting the issues at hand, this partnership is deffo going stronger... can feel it? live DJ's on all the way till 8am? Amazing.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:10:27 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Honestly.

Few teething problems, still a few issues here and there... but amazing so far.

Much better.

We have been pretty booked out for this whole week actually!
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:10:44 GMT+0000 (UTC)
So cheers for the arguments/butting heads we've had.
Kng (501794697677635587) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:10:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's had a good outcome.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:10:59 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It’s been pretty hectic indeed for all of us, but indeed when we work together: we are stronger.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sun Jun 28 2020 05:11:34 GMT+0000 (UTC)
We cannot thank HabMe for giving us another chance as it’s definitely promoted DJs to go on-air a lot more when there’s a lot more listeners.

You can continue to listen to the radio via a relay:

It's really annoying and pathetic. If we receive ddos attacks, it does mean we are doing something correct as a team.

It shouldn't cause your client to go down, that's new. Never heard that before.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sun Jun 28 2020 17:09:07 GMT+0000 (UTC)
It's because it's trying to fetch the player but cant

Zane (278627940403773441) at Sun Jun 28 2020 17:09:42 GMT+0000 (UTC)
I never knew that because whenever Power was ddosed, the radio wouldn't just play on the client and the client wouldn't be slow at all.

<@!501794697677635587> I was going to do a giveaway on air tonight but I think we're going to leave it until tomorrow or Tuesday, just because we want to be sure that we're stable and doing a giveaway might attract interest from whoever is trying to take us down and they'll do it again when we're doing the giveaway.

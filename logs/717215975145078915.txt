Hello,

I just wanted to add onto this topic emphasising the message from my wonderful Administration team (which you can see https://discordapp.com/channels/704843392911409184/704843393255211083/717210872908611584). I don't want to take away from the very very important message that they have said above. I have been scrolling through the media over the past few days and the only feeling that comes over me is a feeling of **anger and resent** but we do not have to settle for it. 

**Derek Chauvin is a murderer but it could have been prevented long before it happened, he had been complained about 18 times prior for demeaning tones and derogatory language.** This is only a sign of the failures of the **United States of America's Institutionalised Racism within the Police Force.** It must end **now**. Trayvon Matin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner are all previous victims amongst many many many more. Those are just the names that get publicised in our press. 

As a team, we are proud to announce that we are launching an initiative here at KeyFM. We can not do much, we are a small community and some would say that we will be unheard but we are joining millions and millions of other people who are already doing something about this. We will not stand-by and just be onlookers. 

Over the next few days, you will see a new Slide appear on our Slider. If you donate Â£1 to Black Lives Matter, please send us proof and once we launch the Slide, we will add your name to it. 

We appreciate that we can't do much but please do whatever you can to help.

<@&704843393250885696> **Afternoon Team** <a:rainbowdance:605565229753040901> 
We're slacking slightly on the slots today. If you have some spare time, please get those minimums in. Remember, we're only asking for two a week and with lockdown it's easily done!

Don't forget, we're on the look out for people who are putting in the 100% effort, and those people will be rewarded ;) 

Now all the way upto midnight is unbooked, get booking team!

<@&709132561783455826> **Morning**
If you didn't already know, we are partnered with a Habbo Retro. This means we'll be reaching into the listener peaks of 35+. So, to entertain our listeners throughout the day, we need to ensure the timetable is all booked up. 

Yesterday, we did alright with getting slots filled, however we can still do better!

Today, we're looking a bit on the low side with slots. If you have a spare hour today, please get a slot booked. As I mentioned last night, we will be distributing reputation points for people who are showing effort. 

Have a look at the timetable below, and get booking team!

Before going on air please check your song titles and ensure they follow the format of: `Artist - Song Name (ft. Artist)`.
Zane (278627940403773441) at Sat May 30 2020 03:28:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)
Before going on air please check your song titles and ensure they follow the format of: `Artist - Song Name (ft. Artist)`. This is mandatory.
ChrisJSY (147751463907622914) at Sat May 30 2020 03:29:49 GMT+0000 (UTC)
The only exception to that is if artists are EQUALLY credited by classification, in which you may use `Artist & Artist - Song Name` or `Artist;Artist - Song Name`. Please also include names of remixes in brackets after the song name! üôÇ

We had quite a good day with our slots yesterday with 15/24 slots booked! Lets keep that activity up today. If you have a spare hour, please book a slot and we will distribute reputation points for those of you who show the effort and drive to go on air! Our peak times seem to be around 3pm-8pm BST, and we had a peak of 90 listeners yesterday! üôÇ Get booking, i'll be tuning in throughout the day!

Just so that you guys know, HabMe are hosting a big giveaway event tonight between 8pm and 2am BST. They will be giving ¬£50/$50 away at some point between those times. As you would expect, this would mean they should have a huge user count so I would love if we could all support that by logging on to the retro and going live tonight! üôÇ

If you cannot DJ this week (15th - 21st), please PM myself so we can log that you are unable to DJ or we can arrange for your slots to be deducted for the week (i.e. 1 or 2 slots required).

Please note, if your reason is not valid enough you will still be required to complete minimums especially if you‚Äôre on trial as a Radio DJ.

If you can only complete 1-2 slots, then so be it: confirmation is required from a Head DJ or higher. 

If you FAIL to provide a reason for why you have not completed your minimums, you will be dealt with fairly and appropriately.

We are knuckling down as we gain 50+ listeners daily and we can not afford to lose our listeners.

**_This is not a chore, nor a task: it is something you enjoy and do as a hobby otherwise you would not be here._**

<@&704843392911409189> 

So I'm only pinging NA because well it only mainly affect the US and Canada oh and Japan.

For **KeyFM** **MONDAY** is the start of the week. So when I say can you complete slots this week that's from Monday till Sunday. (15/06/2020 -> 21/06/2020 (mm/dd/yy))
MegaJoshy (264617372227338241) at Thu Jun 18 2020 15:11:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)
<@&709132561783455826> 

I have messaged pretty much all of you individually to make sure you are completing slots and why none have been completed and I know a lot of you have not even had panel being created so they will be done when you reply. If you need anything else please do let me know otherwise please start booking and completing slots. 

I also want to say something if you are not interested in being a DJ here anymore please do let us know and tell us otherwise we expect you to complete your minimum of 3 slots (Radio DJ) and 1 slot (Guest DJ) per week. If you have anything please do let me know and if you need any training please request it, I have messaged most of you and from my knowledge there is only two of you that need it.

**Hey!** You might have seen that we are looking for ideas for perm shows and because of that I am going to be getting some new imaging and voiceovers but first is VOs, if you have any lines that you would like to be done please let me know. We will also be doing some for perm shows, but for new imaging to be considered for this you will need to submit your request on the google forms, you will be contacted if you have added a perm show to that list. - <@&709132561783455826>

Just letting you know that I still have some space on the VOS, so if you have any lines that you want doing LMK, this can include DJ names.

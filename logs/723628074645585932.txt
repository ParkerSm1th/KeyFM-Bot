Most of my reasons have already been posted in <#704843393959723013> so take a look at my messages in there but listeners is a huge one for me, they aren't stable at all.

Work is the main reason for me. - I'm on night shifts from 8pm - 9am 5 days a week. I also do 2 weekly radio shows elsewhere, which I get paid for:) - I tend to connect for an hour or two early afternoon if i've got time before work and if the slot is free,, otherwise it's mainly on my days off. //// Got some more reasons but you asked for one :p

I'm booked away at the moment, otherwise it isn't a problem with me

Basically, I went out one day with family and i missed work. Even since I been trying to catch up but loads they set is 2 hours :/

And it also builds on when I need to set up someone.

I would love to be able to get on and do as many slots as I can - but with work my shifts are always changing and depends on what orders we have coming in . I think something that would help more of us book would be some more imaging with adverts etc with stuff including whatâ€™s going on in the real world .

<@!335127165089611776> DJs are more than welcome to host more 'realistic' shows. Podcasts, Talk Shows, Just more radio-esque shows if they wish to. However, as Key is not for profit we can't provide imaging for every specific thing, we have plenty of Beds, Jingles, ToHs etc. ðŸ™‚

**How do I write a review?**
• A review can only be written by Head DJs or higher. 

• A review can be written by heading to the panel (Head DJ > Review Assignments).

• The section named overall is a summary of the week, start with how they’ve done for this week and list positives. 

• The section named improvement is an improvement or a next step. The improvement or next step is something that you’d like the assigned user to complete for the upcoming week or improve upon.

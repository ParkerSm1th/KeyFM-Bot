**Securio.tech**

Securio is the new **website protection service** on the block. Securio can not only protect your application or website from (D)DoS attacks but it can also automatically secure and increase the performance at the same time whilst allowing you to point your domain/subdomain to any IP address, and any port of your desire. Upon 'Public Beta' release of Securio, we will be launching a simple 'Plug and Play' dashboard where you can manage your numerous domains and use optional features such as; TLS 1.3 Support, Minification of HTML, CSS and JS, Custom SSL Uploads, Obfuscation of JS and the ability to create a load balancer between two origin servers. This is what we have planned at this current time but the list my vary upon release.
